# face_recognition

the "face_recognition_code.py" is the original file and img.py is the cv2 practise done by me if wanted you can see it.
 it contens face detecrion codes.

 to run the code you must be needed to install some packages usiong pip
1. numpy  
2.camke  
3.dlib  
4.face_recognition  

the basic face indentification code is been ready now .
 needed to unzip the images folder and store in the place where you will store face_recognition.py

thinking of using the Qtpy to desgin the GUI.(Can't use thinker to do so, due to complexity of the code)
